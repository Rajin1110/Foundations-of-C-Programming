# Foundations-of-C-Programming
Welcome to the Foundations of C Programming repository. This repository contains projects and exercises from the "C Language Tutorial for Beginners (With Notes + Surprise)" by CodeWithHarry. It serves as a comprehensive guide to the fundamental concepts of C programming.

Overview
This repository includes practical implementations of key C programming principles. Each project is designed to reinforce understanding and provide hands-on experience with the following topics:

Variables and Data Types: Basics of declaring and using variables and understanding data types.
Control Structures: Implementation of conditional statements (if, else) and loops (for, while, do-while).
Functions and Recursion: Defining functions, passing arguments, and utilizing recursion.
Arrays and Strings: Managing collections of data and manipulating strings.
Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation: Understanding pointers, memory management, and dynamic allocation.
Structures and Unions: Working with complex data types and their applications.
